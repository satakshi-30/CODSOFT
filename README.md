# CODSOFT
This repository containing tasks completed during my CODSOFT internship in ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE
Covers hands-on coding, problem-solving, and project building.
# MY FIRST TASK IS TIC-TAC-TOE AI GAME 
This program is a Tic-Tac-Toe game where the player is X and the AI is O.
The board is displayed in a 3×3 grid format.
The game checks for winners or a full board after each move.
The AI uses the minimax algorithm to always choose the best possible move.
Player inputs their move (0–8), which is validated before updating the board.
If the player wins, the game announces “You win!”.
If the AI wins, it announces “AI wins!”.
If no one wins and the board is full, it announces a draw.
# MY SECOND TASK IS CHATBOT WITH RULE-BASED RESPONSES
The chatbot responds to greetings, identity, name, time, weather, and exits with "bye".
Handles greetings (hi, hello).
Answers basic questions like name, identity, and weather.
Can show the current time.
Ends gracefully when the user types "bye".
